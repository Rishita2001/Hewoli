Bridging the virtual trio: Health, Work, and LifeConnecting the world through solutions that willaccelerate the transformation of virtual health, work, and life.

This project will explore and show the impacts of releasing personal data to health and exercise apps. With an artifical intelligence program, students will be able to choose what physical health data is accessible and then see what other medical information can be determined from these small pieces of recorded data. Physical health data will include calorie intake, heart rate, step count, distance walked, minutes of activity, and minutes of rest inlcuding possible other factors. Predicitive analytics will be used in combination with connection to a medical database in the Python programming language for specific medical predictions according to small pieces of information. This tool will allow students to see how health and wellness data can be used, giving them the opportunity to understand and further discuss the ethics of releasing personal information to fitness trackers and health-related applications.

The purpose of this tool is to specifically aid students in having complex conversations about data collection and the ethics surrounding it. Specifically, this tool focuses on the impact of releasing personal health and wellness information. Artifical intelligence is a quickly growing field, raising ethical debates daily. In the case of healthcare, AI is beginning to be used for both diagnostics, and personalized medicine. However, with this growing field, arise concerns related to privacy, informed consent, and patient autonomy. This tool will give students insight into how personal health data can, and often is used, allowing them to form opinions about the ethics surrounding this field. In an artifical intelligence course, one of the most important ideas is to integrate the teaching of ethics, and allow students to form their own opinions about the use and growth of AI.
